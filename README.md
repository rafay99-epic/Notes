## Introduction:
I love to write blogs, but I don't like the format in which blogs are written, so I searched and came across something called Markdown, and from the moment I tried it, I loved it.

## Save on Github:
I have been using Markdown for making notes and writing blogs on my website. The problem with these markdown files is that they can be lost or deleted by mistake, so I decided to save them, and the best way to save some piece of code is to deploy it on Github, so here it is.

Every time I publish a blog, I will also store it on github in the form of a markdown file.
