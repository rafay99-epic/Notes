## Introduction:

Hi! My name is Abdul Rafay, and I work as a Web Development and Machine Learning Engineer. I recently finished my studies, and I’ve been working in the web development industry for a while, but machine learning is a new field for me. I’m learning, and my passion grows as my experience in this field grows. So as a developer, I’ll show you some of the tools that are awesome to work with when you are in the field of machine learning and web development.

The tools that I used are not in any particular order; they are all amazing in their own unique way and helped me get the job done. So here are the tools that I use in my day-to-day life.

1.  Visual Studio Code
2.  Notion
3.  Anaconda3 Environment
4.  PowerShell in conjunction with a Window Terminal
5.  Python
6.  Brave Browser

So here are the tools that I used in my daily life to get my job done.

## Tools:

### 1. **Visual Studio Code:**

-   Visual Studio Code is a great editor; it is available for all operating systems. As an operating system, I used Windows and Linux, so just one config file got me all the extensions that I needed to get started.
-   I used VS Code for coding a different project, whether it be a web project or a model that I need to train to get the job done; with its customization, I can truly make it my own.
-   To download visual studio code click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### 2. Notion:

-   Notion is great; it’s my second brain, and I keep everything in my notion. I write a lot of blogs and write a lot of documentation for different projects, so I use notion to keep track of all the documentation.
-   Notion is available for only two operating systems: **Windows** and **Mac OS,** which can be downloaded by [clicking here,](https://www.notion.so/desktop) but there is an AUR [package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/notion-app) for Arch Linux and a [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/notion-snap) for an Ubuntu or Debian-based distro.
-   There are so many features of notion that I cannot even explain them, so here is a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61a1Edq4iBo) that will help you understand the features of notion.

### 3. Anaconda3 Environment:

-   Anaconda is a data science tool that can help you set up different Python environments, and not just environments but also different Python versions, for different projects. Each Python version is its own separate bubble and won’t affect any other environments.
-   These environments are created by a package manager, whose name is Conda**.**
-   Anaconda is available on all operating systems and works great when you are using different versions of Python on different projects without messing with your core system's Python installation.
-   To download the package, [click here.](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
-   For the installation process, view the documentation by [clicking here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

### 4. PowerShell in conjunction with a Window Terminal:

-   I use various operating systems; on Windows, I use the window terminal, and my shell is PowerShell.
-   PowerShell by default with Windows is okay, but it doesn’t have all the features of the new PowerShell, so for my work flow I used PowerShell 7.
-   Window Terminal is great, speedy, and customizable, so I use it to start different environments, like WSL, and search through files using Window Terminal.
-   PowerShell is available on all operating systems, but Window Terminal is only available on Windows. For Windows, both can be found on the Microsoft Store.

### 5. Python:

-   We all know that math is important for machine learning, and we need a way to convert our logic into a code that computers can understand.
-   So for a programming language, I use Python. It’s great for everything.
-   Mainly, I use Python for data science and training different models for projects.
-   Python is an open-source project and is available on all operating systems. It is everywhere.

### 6. Brave Browser

-   For my main browsing work, I use Brave. Because of the lower memory usage and the fact that ads are free and customization is possible with Chrome extensions,
-   Brave is great and can be downloaded on all operating systems.
-   I use Brave for two reasons: great support for Chrome extensions and godly speed with less RAM usage. I open a lot of tabs, and these tabs take up a lot of RAM space, so I use Brave to keep everything under control.
-   To download the browser, [click here](https://brave.com/download/).

## Final Thoughts:

Tools can help you to move fast but your skills can make you or break you in our field, so here are the tools that I use on daily bases, what tools do you use let me know.
