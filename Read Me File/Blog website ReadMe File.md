# Rafay blog Website:
---
## Introduction:
I'm a developer, and I have been developing applications for a while, but with time, I have seen that my skills are increasing, but every time I learn something new, I forget the old thing.

I do make notes, but writing with my hands is not a great solution, so I decided to blog, but the question is, where? So I decided to try a different blogging website and a couple of note-taking applications.

Such as Medium or Notion, but these are great, but I didn't get the feel of writing blogs, and to be honest, the writing experience was just okay on Medium and Notion.

I love Markdown; it's flexible and works like a champ. I have been using markdown for something like three months, and I wanted some place where I could post my blogs in markdown.

Hey! What I'm thinking is that I am a developer; I can build a blogging website. It will be easy, and I can do whatever I want with it.

## Exiting Solutions
So I went online and started looking for existing solutions, and boy, did I find a lot of them, but they are either very time-consuming or lack the feature that I was looking for.

When I was researching for blog website, I have to make a couple of key choices that was, which technologies I will be using to develop and code my application, 

So before that, I need to decide whether I need a dynamic website or a static website since I want to post just blogs on my website, so I will go with a static website. There are a few good reasons to go with a static website, such as speed and ease of configuration and coding. Because I don't have time to build a dynamic website, I'm going with a static website, but you can choose your own framework, such as React, Angular, or any other framework.

Not just a any static website, I need a way to post blogs without creating an admin dashboard and this was super important, I am trying to avoid an entire full system. 

So after searching like alot I came across something called **HUGO**. 

### What is HUGO:
Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.

Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a [static site generator](https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/). Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.





## Desired characteristics:
So before we look at what I choose, here are the features that I am looking for in a blogging website.

- Post blogs using Markdown.  
- Easy to Post Blogs  
- There is no login.  
- No security  
- No ads  
- Good Color Scheme  
- Has the ability to switch between light and dark modes.  
- Blogs by Category  
- Tags for Blogs  
- Each blog's date and time  
- Support for code and images  
- The existing code is simple to read and modify

So these are some of the features that I am looking for.
